This is the code for the second solo project for the scrimba
course - Learn React for free, https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

The goal was to make a static travel journar where the data is read from a file
and use props to help dislpay it all.

This is made in my local environment instead of inside scrimba so I created a
new React project with npx create-react-app and then the local server
is started with npm start.
